# 🚀 **Overview**

This project is a complete **AI-driven invoice extraction pipeline** that:

✔ Enhances raw images for OCR
✔ Extracts structured fields using **IBM WatsonX LLM**
✔ Performs **high-accuracy validation** (GST, phone, IMEI, dates, tax %)
✔ Handles **multi-line invoices**, tax logic & amount corrections
✔ Generates **Excel reports** with Item-Details & Invoice-Summary
✔ Calculates **confidence scores** for audit reliability
✔ Applies **proportional adjustment** when extracted totals mismatch

It is built for real-world business use where invoices vary widely in format, clarity, and structure.

# ✨ **Features**

## 🔧 **1. Advanced Image Preprocessing**

✔ Upscaling for better DPI
✔ Denoising, Grayscale conversion
✔ Adaptive thresholding
✔ Batch processing support and Automated folder processing

Improves OCR accuracy significantly for low-quality invoices.

---

## 🤖 **2. AI Extraction using IBM WatsonX**

The LLM extracts **structured JSON** including:

### **Header Fields**

* Invoice Number (with handwritten/printed detection)
* Invoice Date
* Supplier & Customer details
* GSTIN (validated)
* Stamp & Signature detection

### **Item Table Extraction**

* Item numbers
* Description (cleaned + brand identification)
* IMEI / Serial Number extraction
* Quantity, Rate, Amount
* SGST / CGST / IGST %
* Tax calculation correctness rules

---

## 🧠 **3. Multi-Layer Validation Engine**

✔ GST format & state-code validation
✔ IMEI (15-digit) verification
✔ Phone number & date validation
✔ Tax % correctness checks
✔ Cross-field corrections with logging

---

## 📤 **4. Clean Excel Reporting**

Exports 2 sheets:

### **Sheet 1 → Item_Details**

* One row per item
* All extracted + validated fields
* Excel table formatting

### **Sheet 2 → Invoice_Summary**

* One row per invoice
* Total amounts
* Confidence scores
* Stamp match score
* Tax-inclusive flag

---

# ⚙️ **Setup & Installation**

## 1️⃣ Install Python Packages

```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas openpyxl ibm-watsonx-ai
```

---

## 2️⃣ Configure API & Paths

Inside `Extractor.py`, update:

```python
RAW_IMAGES_DIR = r".../INPUT_IMAGES"
PREPROCESSED_DIR = r".../PROCESSED_IMAGES"
EXCEL_OUTPUT_PATH = r".../output.xlsx"

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
MODEL_ID = "meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8"
```

---
## 3️⃣ Run the Complete Extraction Pipeline

```sh
python Extractor.py
```

---

# 🧪 **Output**

### ✔ Excel file with:

* Item-level details
* Invoice summary
* Confidence scores

### ✔ Logs include:

* Invalid GST fixes
* Phone/date corrections
* Amount mismatches
* Retry attempts
